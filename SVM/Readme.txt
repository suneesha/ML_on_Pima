Part 3: Support Vector Machine

Included libraries e1071 and fortunes
SVM function in e1071 is used for creating the model.

Note: Kernel type "polynomial" was only working for normalized data which is accomplished by the fortunes package.

Radial and Sigmoid kernels(both normalized and not normalized) do not work well with the dataset.

Linear gives the best Accuracy.
